# Code-quiz

this assignment was a complete failure

there were multiple ideas in my head that i want to create but couldnt not execute for example
when clicking the start button i wanted it to go to the quiz it self but didnt know how to.

so instead i use window prompt to display my question. but as you can see, once you answer thus question nothing else happen.

this was the braking point for me. hopeful during the weeks go by i will have a better understanding of this a will re-submit as quick as possible
